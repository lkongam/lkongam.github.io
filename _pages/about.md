I'm a third-year undergraduate student (expected graduate year: 2027) at **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)**, majoring in Computer Science with a second major in Mathematics.

My research interests include:

- **Machine Learning System (MLSys), mainly focusing on designing efficient CUDA kernels and using LLMs to help develop ML systems.**
- **Cuda Kernel Generation**, Using LLMs to generate correct and efficient CUDA kernels.  
- **LLM Reasoning and Chain of Thought (CoT)**, especially focusing on the reasoning process of code generation.

I will be an **exchange student at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)**.
