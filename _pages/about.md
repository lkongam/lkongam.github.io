I'm a third-year undergraduate student(expected graduate year: 2027) at **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)**, majoring in Computer Science with a second major in Mathematics.

My research interests include:

- **Cuda Kernel Generation**, Using LLMs to generate correct and efficient CUDA kernels.
